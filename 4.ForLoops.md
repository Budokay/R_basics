For Loops
================

This is a R conversion of a tutorial by [FC Python](http://fcpython.com/python-basics/for-loops). I take no credit for the idea and have their blessing to make this conversion. All text is a direct copy unless changes were relevant. Please follow them on [twitter](www.twitter.com/FC_Python) and if you have a desire to learn Python then they are a fantastic resource!

Everything that we have seen so far has involved us giving a program a single instruction and asking it to run. This is not particularly efficient if we want to do the same thing several times over. We would much rather find a way to automate this and run the task multiple times for us, for loops are the perfect way to get started here.

Lists
-----

We cover lists and other group concepts elsewhere, but a list is simply a way to group lots of things into one variable. A list has lots of functions that make it easy to work with – please see its own page for more on this. This list is a 3-a-side team selected to play in a TV commercial.

``` r
TeamA = c("Nasta","Overvenus","Ranalda")
```

The TV commercial wants to announce these players to the crowd. We can do this individually for each:

``` r
print(paste0("Welcome to the cage, ", TeamA[1]))
```

    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Nasta"

``` r
print(paste0("Welcome to the cage, ", TeamA[2]))
```

    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Overvenus"

``` r
print(paste0("Welcome to the cage, ", TeamA[3]))
```

    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Ranalda"

Notice how we repeated ourself three times? ‘For loops’ help us to avoid doing so. The smarter announcer is run using the following code:

``` r
for (player in TeamA) {
  print(paste0("Welcome to the cage, ", player))
}
```

    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Nasta"
    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Overvenus"
    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Ranalda"

Our output is exactly the same, but the code looks so much better!

The essential bits to our code are the words ‘for’ and ‘in’, \*\*\*

Plus, we could also add a second team really really easily with a ‘nested for-loop’ – this is a for-loop inside a for-loop!

``` r
#Team 2, enter!
TeamB = c("Tatti","Nikita","Hanry")

#A list of lists!
Teams <- c(TeamA,TeamB)

for (team in Teams) {
  for (player in team) {
    print(paste0("Welcome to the cage, ", player))
  }
}
```

    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Nasta"
    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Overvenus"
    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Ranalda"
    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Tatti"
    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Nikita"
    ## [1] "Welcome to the cage, Hanry"

So cool!

Summary
-------

If we have to write down every single thing that we want our code to do, it will be hugely inefficient and a bit of a pain to write. We can utilise for loops to automate any repetition and to try our best to avoid duplicate code. In fact, programming has a DRY mantra – “Don’t repeat yourself”.

Our examples above demonstrate a nested for-loop too – a loop within a loop to push our automation even further.

Give them a try yourself, and check out while loops when you’re comfortable here!
