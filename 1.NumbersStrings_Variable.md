Numbers, Strings and Variables in R
================

This is a R conversion of a tutorial by [FC Python](http://fcpython.com/python-basics/numbers-string-variables-python). I take no credit for the idea and have their blessing to make this conversion. All text is a direct copy unless changes were relevant. Please follow them on [twitter](www.twitter.com/FC_Python) and if you have a desire to learn Python then they are a fantastic resource!

Football is full of numbers, names, lists, teams and a million other ‘things’ that make up our understanding of what is happening.

In the same way, R has lots of different ways of classifying things that it can understand. For example, it uses numbers to count, ‘strings’ for names and even has ways to group these things – like we would need for a league. This introductory post takes a look at a couple of these data types.

Numbers
-------

As its simplest, R is a calculator:

``` r
1+1
```

    ## [1] 2

``` r
10*2
```

    ## [1] 20

``` r
20/2
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r
# ** = to the power of
2**3
```

    ## [1] 8

Variables
---------

While a calculator is incredibly useful, we can give these numbers a name and a placeholder so that they are a bit more tangible and applicable to a problem. For example, if I want to keep track of our top scorer’s shots and goals:

``` r
Ronney_Goals <- 15
Ronney_Shots <- 63
```

I could now calculate Ronney’s conversion rate! Dividing goals by shots, I can see how many shots it takes him to score.

``` r
Ronney_Conversion = Ronney_Goals/Ronney_Shots
Ronney_Conversion
```

    ## [1] 0.2380952

Strings
-------

Now that R has some interesting information on Ronney, it wants to share it with the world. As we can see above, sharing a number by itself doesn’t tell us a great deal. However, a string of text can give us a bit of context.

Surround a piece of text in quotation marks (be consistent with single or double quotes) to create a string:

``` r
"Ronney is truly a great player, his conversion rate speaks for itself."
```

    ## [1] "Ronney is truly a great player, his conversion rate speaks for itself."

…and let’s use the print() and paste0() commands to add the evidence to our commentator’s opinion.

``` r
print(paste0("His conversion rate of ", Ronney_Conversion, " is sublime"))
```

    ## [1] "His conversion rate of 0.238095238095238 is sublime"

That is a bit specific, Merse, but I appreciate the information! Let’s take a look at those two commands:

print() – R, please print everything that I put into the brackets.

paste0() – R, combine this segments of text and numbers

Summary
-------

In this introductory post, we have seen that R can be used as a calculator at its very simplest. However, we have seen that we can make it a bit more useful with variables, even using a variable to help our commentator give a great bit of insight, combining it with a string.

We even saw a couple of commands with print() and paste0().

Next up, take a look at how we compare and evaluate this information in R to make decisions with our code.
